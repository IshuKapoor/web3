                        <p>A vintage car is, in the most general sense, an old automobile, and in the narrower senses of car 
                           enthusiasts and collectors, it is a car from the period of 1919 to 1930. Such enthusiasts have 
                           categorization schemes for ages of cars that enforce distinctions between antique cars, 
                           vintage cars, classic cars, and so on. The classification criteria vary, but consensus within 
                           any country is often maintained by major car clubs, for example the Vintage Sports-Car Club 
                           (VSCC) in the UK.</p>

                    <p>A phonograph, in its later forms also called a gramophone (as a trademark 
                       since 1887, as a generic name in the UK since 1910) or since the 1940s called 
                       a record player, is a device for the mechanical recording and reproduction of 
                       sound. The sound vibration waveforms are recorded as corresponding physical 
                       deviations of a spiral groove engraved, etched, incised, or impressed into the 
                       surface of a rotating cylinder or disc, called a "record". To recreate the sound, 
                       the surface is similarly rotated while a playback stylus traces the groove and is 
                       therefore vibrated by it, very faintly reproducing the recorded sound. In early 
                       acoustic phonographs, the stylus vibrated a diaphragm which produced sound waves 
                       which were coupled to the open air through a flaring horn, or directly to the listener's 
                       ears through stethoscope-type earphones.</p>

                        <p>Snow comprises individual ice crystals that grow while suspended in the atmosphere—usually 
                           within clouds—and then fall, accumulating on the ground where they undergo further changes.
                           It consists of frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable 
                           conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and 
                           accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away.</p>
